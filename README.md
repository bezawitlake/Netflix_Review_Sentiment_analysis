# Netflix_Review_Sentiment_analysis

# Overview

This project explores sentiment analysis techniques using Python to analyze Netflix reviews. It covers a range of methodologies including machine learning, deep learning, and pretrained models like BERT for sentiment classification. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide and practical implementation for understanding and mastering sentiment analysis in natural language processing (NLP).

# Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess Netflix review data for sentiment analysis.
2. Visualization: Visualize sentiment distributions and word clouds to gain insights from the data.
3. Machine Learning Models: Train traditional ML models like SVM and Random Forests for sentiment classification.
4. Deep Learning Models: Implement deep learning models such as RNNs, LSTMs, and Bidirectional LSTMs for sentiment analysis.
5. Pretrained Models: Fine-tune pretrained models like BERT and GPT on Netflix reviews to leverage their contextual understanding.
6. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
